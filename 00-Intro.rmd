# Note that R is case sensitive.

# COMMENTING 
# As you may have guessed, '#' is the comment character in R
# Anything on a line following a '#' will be ignored by R

### In RStudio, you can add or remove "#" from the beginning of lines
### by typing shift + command + c or going to Code => Comment/Uncomment Lines in 
### the menu. Try this.

### To run a line from the source into the console, place the blinking cursor
### anywhere on that line and press command and enter on a mac or control and
### enter on a pc. Try it with the next line:

# USING R AS A CALCULATOR 

5 + 4
10 - 8
14/4
22*4
7^2

# Built-in arithmetic functions
sqrt(49)
exp(1)
log(exp(10))
sin(pi/2)
cos(pi)

3 + (4 - 2)
3 + 4(4 - 2) # throws an error
3 + 4*(4 - 2) # no error
1e5 - 100 # scientific notation; 1e5 = 100000


# ASSIGNING VALUES 
x <- 50

# Equivalently, you can use = sign
x = 50

x
x + 7
x*3
x^2
X # throws an error because case sensitive
y <- 2000
x + y
z <- y/x
z

# Sequences
1:20 # sequence from 1 to 20 by 1s
20:1
2.3:24.3

x <- 1:10
### Notice we just redefined x; old x is gone forever so be careful with reassignments
x + 3
4 * x
x^2
c(1, 4, 2, 3) # "c" is used to create a vector
y <- c(4, 2, 7)

# INSTALLING AND USING PACKAGES 
# Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code bundled 
# up into a well-defined format that makes them easily importable into R.

library() # shows you which packages are available.

### Search the internet for details about package "car". Then install it.
install.packages('car') 
### If you haven't done so already, R will ask you which CRAN mirror
### to download from. After that it will be your default.
### The package car (companion to applied regression) will be installed, 
### along with any dependent packages it requires. At this point, although 
### we just *installed* the package, we have not yet *loaded* it into the 
### current workspace.

library(car)

### Once the packcage has been loaded you can use its functions and access
### its help and data examples (if any)

data() # Shows all example data sets currently loaded.

# Built-in dataset iris is a classical example of multivariate data
data(iris)
iris

# Data matrix:
X = iris[ ,1:4]
# Notice we selected only columns 1 to 4, as the fifth is non-numerical
X
dim(X) # X is a 150x4 matrix. That is, n = 150, p = 4

# The 4 column means
x.bar = colMeans(X)
x.bar

# To obtain the variances we can use the apply command.
# It applies any function on either the rows or columns of a matrix:
s.sq = apply(X, MARGIN = 2, var)
s.sq
# Notice MARGIN = 2 means to apply the function to the columns; use 1 for rows

# Covariance matrix:
cov(X)
# Note that the diagonal elements are exactly the variances
# Alternative method to obtain the variances:
diag(cov(X))

# Correlation matrix
cor(X)

# To make dataset names directly available we attach the data:
attach(iris)

# Graphs:
# 1. Histograms - plot one variable at a time
hist(Sepal.Width)

# Can be smoothed to a density estimate:
plot(density(Sepal.Width))

# 2. Scatterplots - two variables
plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)

# Can be done as a scatterplot matrix each pair of numerical variables:
pairs(iris[, 1:4])

# Or specific species
pairs(iris[101:150, 1:4])

# Better scatterplot matrix in the lattice library function splom
install.packages("lattice")
